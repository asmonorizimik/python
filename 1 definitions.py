#LIST: list are one of the sequence built-in data type that used to store multiple items in a 
# single variable.
##Eg: list=["manori",22,43.10,"a+"]
##life example:inside our pouch we can put pencils, erasers, colours,rubberbands,sweets,phones

##IMPORTANCE :Lists are great to use when you want to work with many related values. They enable 
# us to keep data together that belongs together, and perform the same methods
# and operations on multiple values at once.


#DATA-TYPE: built -in function that represent the type of value and determines how the value can be 
# used in a python program.

#BUILT-IN FUNCTION:The Python built-in functions are defined as the functions whose functionality
#  is pre-defined in Python.

#FUNCTION:Function is a block of code that only runs when it is called

###ARRAY:A Python Array is a collection of common type of data structures having elements with
#same data type. It is used to store collections of data. 

##SLICE:slicing refers to accessing a specific portion or a subset of the list for some 
# operation while the orginal list remains unaffected. The slicing operator in python can take
#  3 parameters out of which 2 are optional depending on the requirement.(uses clon(:))

##SLICING:"Slicing‚Äù means getting a subset of elements from an iterable based on their indices.

##ACESSING:Elements of the list can be accessed by the index of the element in the list. 
##(acess:approach / enter / get)


##INDEX:An index is a numerical representation of an item's position in a sequence.
##An index refers to a position within an ordered list. Python strings can be
# thought of as lists of characters; each character is given an index from zero (at the beginning)
# to the length minus one (at the end).
# each individual character is given a location number, called index


##INDEXING:Indexing in Python is a way to refer the individual items within an iterable by its position.
##Consider the syntax x[obj] where x is the array and obj is the index.
